## Labs

Each labs has a main folder with the following structure

```text
lab-name
|
|- readme.md
|- starter-code
    |-index.html
    |-styles
    |-scripts
    |-readme.md
|- solution-code
    |-index.html
    |-styles
    |-scripts
    |-readme.md
starter-code.zip
solution-code.zip
```

The idea behind it, is to have in the same repo a reference for the lab with a link to download a zip

## Development

Once you finished creating/amending a lab, run the following to delete the zip file for the solution/starter code and compress and create a new ones

```sh
yarn workspace labs build
```
