## The Student Experience

- Open and friendly learning environment
- Supportive, collaborative
- Friendly yet challenging
- Learn by doing - and making mistakes!
- Be curious - ask lots of questions
- Remember: no question is a stupid question

---

## Our Promise

- We‚Äôll focus on practical skills
- We‚Äôll teach you how to continue learning

---

## Learn by Doing

- Throughout the course we'll be creating lots of small projects to learn the various languages and techniques.

- The goal is to work towards creating a final project of your choosing and presenting it to the class on the final session

---

## Process First, Syntax Second

- This course is very practical but aims to teach you a process so you can replicate the material in your own projects.

- You don't need to remember everything we cover in detail. You just need to remember the gist of it so you look things up online and in the notes.

# Tell the difference...

Please, tell us the difference between:

## Frontend vs Backend

---

# Frontend vs. Backend

The development process can be broken into two areas:

### Front-End

- How things look to the user
- Involves: images, content, structure
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

---

### Back-End

- How things work
- Involves: ‚Äúbusiness logic‚Äù and ‚Äúdata‚Äù
- Ruby, PHP, C++, Java, etc.

# The 3 Layers of the Web

# The 3 Layers of the Web

- **HTML** is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content.
- **CSS** is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content.
- **JavaScript** is a scripting language that enables you to manipulate dynamically content and style.

---

# Intro to HTML

**HTML** _(Hypertext Markup Language)_ is not a programming language; it is a markup language used to tell your browser how to structure the web pages you visit.

# Intro to HTML

`My cat is very grumpy`

<CodePane>
  {`
<p>My cat is very grumpy</p>
`}
</CodePane>

# Nesting elements

## What is the difference?

<CodePane>
  {`
<p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>
`}
</CodePane>

### between

<CodePane>

<p>My cat is <strong>very grumpy.</p></strong>

# Nesting elements

## Good:

<CodePane>
  {`
<p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>
`}
</CodePane>

## ~~Bad~~:

<CodePane>
  {`
<p>My cat is <strong>very grumpy.</p></strong>

# Block versus inline elements

There are two important categories of elements in HTML which you should know about. They are **block-level** elements and **inline** elements.

---

# Block

- They will appear on a new line from whatever content went before it, and any content that goes after it will also appear on a new line.
- Tend to be structural elements on the page that represent, for example, paragraphs, lists, navigation menus, footers, etc.
- A block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might be nested inside another block-level element.

<CodePane>
  {`
<p>Paragraph</p>
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li>list item</li>
  </ul>
</nav>
`}
</CodePane>

---

## Inline

- Are contained within block-level elements and surround only small parts of the document‚Äôs content, not entire paragraphs and groupings of content.
- Will not cause a new line to appear in the document; they would normally appear inside a paragraph of text.
- For example an `<a>` element (hyperlink) or emphasis elements such as `<em>` or `<strong>`.

<CodePane>
  {`
<p>
  Here is a link to <a href="www.ga.co">General Assembly</a>. Here is an
  <em>emphasis</em>. and here is a <span>common wrapper</span>
</p>
`}
</CodePane>

---

# Empty elements

Are self closing elements

<CodePane>
  {`
<img
  src="https://api.peteroftheday.com/random"
  alt="A random Picture of Peter Martin"
/>
<hr />
<input type="color" id="color" />
`}
</CodePane>

## Headings and Paragraphs

<CodePane>
  {`
<p>I am a paragraph, oh yes I am.</p>
<h1>I am the title of the story.</h1>
`}
</CodePane>

## Implementing structural hierarchy

<CodePane>
{`<h1>Star Wars</h1>
<p>By George Lucas</p>

<h2>Episode IV: A New Hope</h2>
<p>It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships ...</p>

<h2>Episode V: The Empire Strike Back</h2>
<p>It is a dark time for the Rebellion...</p>
<h3>EXT. GALAXY - PLANET HOTH</h3>
<p>
  A Star Destroyer moves through space, releasing Imperial probe robots from its
  underside.

# HTML text fundamentals

## Why do we need semantics?

<CodePane>
  {`<h1>This is a top level heading</h1>
<span style="font-size: 32px; margin: 21px 0;">
  Is this a top level heading?
</span>`}
</CodePane>
