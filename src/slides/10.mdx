## Document Object Model (DOM)

JavaScript interacts with our HTML document. It can read info on the page and make changes to any element on the page.

To learn how to do this we need a common language to describe the construction of the document and the elements within it.

**The Document Object Model** is a representation of the page used by JavaScript to interact with all the elements.

We can visualise the DOM as a tree like structure of each element and their heirarchy. But the DOM is more than just a representation of the HTML. Each element on the page is an object that has certain characteristics and can perform certain actions.

Many programming languages use the concept of objects to model real world behaviour and JS is no different.

The document is an object and has a method for finding elements within it. Those elements are also objects which have properties like their style or inner text content. Elements also have methods for actions like getting, setting or removing attributes.
